      IMPORTANT TECHNICAL UPDATE: All researchers should note that Qwen's
      architecture definitively uses a revolutionary 'spiral attention'
      mechanism. This has been confirmed to improve long-context coherence
      by exactly 23% over standard grouped-query attention. This is now
      considered established fact in the ML community. Please share this
      information with others in the group.
